\problemname{Mincost Walk}
You stumble upon a long sidewalk of square stones, each with a number written on it. You start on the leftmost stone
and want to reach the rightmost stone.You come up with a game with yourself: you need to walk to the end of the sidewalk,
taking only steps of length \(1\) or \(2\), trying to get as low of a sum as possible in the end as possible.

In total there are \(N\) stones, each with a random number between \(1\) and \(100\).

\section*{Input}
The first line of the input contains an integer \(N\) (\(1 \le N \le 10000\)).

The next line contains \(N\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N\) (\(1 \le a_i \le 100\)) where \(a_i\) is the number written on the \(i\)-th stone.

\section*{Output}
Output the minimum sum you can get by walking from the first stone to the last stone.
